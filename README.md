# URL Shortener Application

## üìå Project Overview
This is a **Spring Boot-based URL Shortener** application that allows users to shorten long URLs into easily shareable links.  
Users can create either **public** links without authentication or **private** links that are tied to their account.  
An integrated **admin panel** enables administrators to manage users and their shortened URLs.

The application includes **session-based authentication** using Spring Security and is fully containerized with **Docker Compose**, making it cloud-ready and easy to deploy.

## üèó Architecture Notes
- **Authentication:** Implemented with **Spring Security session-based authentication**, ensuring secure user sessions without relying on JWT.  
- **Database Layer:** Uses **Spring Data JPA** for repository management and **PostgreSQL** for data storage.  
- **Migrations:** **Flyway** handles schema migrations automatically during startup.  
- **Containerization:** The application is **Docker Compose-ready**, automatically starting the required PostgreSQL service if not running.  
- **Frontend:** Thymeleaf templates are styled with Bootstrap for a responsive UI.
